These are CNF fuzzers for 'dualiza' both for SAT and Counting mode.
The CNF fuzzer and delta-debugger are included for convenience.

Just use

  ./fuzz-dualiza-sat-cnf.sh

or

  ./fuzz-dualiza-count-cnf.sh

to start the fuzzing and 'make clean' to kill all fuzzing processes
and also remove the bugs and reduced files.
