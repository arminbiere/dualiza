These are AIG fuzzers for 'dualiza' both for SAT and Counting mode.
The AIGER tools for fuzzing and delta-debugging are included for convenience.
Just use

  ./fuzz-dualiza-sat-aig.sh

or

  ./fuzz-dualiza-count-aig.sh

to start the fuzzing and 'make clean' to kill all fuzzing processes
and also remove the bugs and reduced files.
